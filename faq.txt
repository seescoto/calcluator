FAQ:

What is this?

- This is a calculator that can process numbers in base 2 (binary), base 10 (decimal), and base 16 (hexadecimal). You can set the calculator as one of the three bases, enter the calculation you want, and then see the answer in real-time. Calculations in base 10 will have input/output in the real numbers, while calculations in base 2 or base 16 will have input/output in the integers.


What does each button do?

- {prev}: Returns the last calculated value from both the equation field and the answer field and for the user to see or change.
- {ans}: Returns last calculated answer from the answer field and copies it into the equation field for the user to use in their next calculation.
- {clear}: Pressing once will clear the equation and answer fields on the calculator but won't affect long-term memory. Pressing clear twice will clear all past calculations and make prev useless until a new calculation is entered. THIS MAY TAKE A FEW SECONDS. Depending on how many previous calculations you've entered, you might have to wait a little bit for it to finish clearing.
- {HEX/DEC/BIN}: Sets the calculators base to either 16, 10, or 2, respectively.
- {Help?}: Take a guess :)
