to do:

- help page  
- make readme better somehow

extras: 

- allow for entry via keyboard (but only valid chars) 
- make distinction between disabled/enabled buttons more noticeable


fix?
-calcFunctions, evalPostFix ln 151 : dont need the check for pi/e anymore since only available in base 10?
-calcFunctions, clear ln 78 : also clear ans field when clear is pressed?
